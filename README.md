This is a Monorepo of projects I've written in **C++** to exercise my ability in the language.

> While I occasionally use AI to improve my learning experience, I shall not *vibe code* at any giving point in this repository, since that's no longer exercising.

## Purpose
This Repository serves as the following:
* **Archive** of Exercises and their versions
* **Documentation** of my Thought Process
* **Learning Resource** for Anyone passing by
* **Case Study** of a Developer's Growth

## Dependencies
Will increase as I exercise more

## Licensing
Pretty much all my projects here are Unlicensed so yeh go crazy.

Any Third-Party Libraries I've used on the exercises retain their original licenses.
